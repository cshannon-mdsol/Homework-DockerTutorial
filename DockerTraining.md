# Docker Training

1. Part 1: Orientation and setup
    * Ran smooth for most with the exception of creating the yaml file and creating the pod. I had to modify the example given and remove the whitespace that was created from cut and paste.

2. Containerizing an application
    * Not sure if the node-bulletin-board was supposed to end up in this repository but I followed the instructions using terminal. Seeing an app run, and testing it, on localhost was really cool.
