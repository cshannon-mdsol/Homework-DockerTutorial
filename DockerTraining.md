# Docker Training

1. Part 1: Orientation and setup
    * Ran smooth for most with the exception of creating the yaml file and creating the pod. I had to modify the example given and remove the whitespace that was created from cut and paste.

2. Part 2: Containerizing an application
    * Not sure if the node-bulletin-board was supposed to end up in this repository but I followed the instructions using terminal. Seeing an app run, and testing it, on localhost was really cool.
    * Ended up having to delete the nested repository because of an error Commit failed - exit code 1 received

3. Part 3: Deploying to Kubernetes
    * Completed and created the bulletin board a different way.

4. Part 4: Deploying a Swarm
    * Yet another way to create the bulletin board.

5. Part 5: Sharing images on Docker Hub
    * Completed outside of GitHub using only Docker and Terminal. https://hub.docker.com/r/cmshannon/bulletinboard

6. Part 6: There is no longer a Part 6 on the website.
